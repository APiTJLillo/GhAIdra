Add function simulation using Ghidra pcode, use AI to suggest inputs to the function(s) and run them
Get recursion working
 - Recursively build a list of all functions
 - Ensure we ignore functions already in the list
 - Analyze/rename functions at the deepest level first
 - Allow for different models to be used at shallower levels if we want smarter models on more important functions
 - Similar to the python script, rename all functions with the same instructions as the current one
